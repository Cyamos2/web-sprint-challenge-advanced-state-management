# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What problem does the context API help solve?
It provides a way to "pass" data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
Actions - Javascript code that has a type field.
Reducers - Determines changes to an application's state.
Store - It holds information about changes within your application, represented as a single Javascript Object.

3. What does `redux-thunk` allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
Makes the flow asynchronous and make API calls from action creators.

4. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
Actions, it is because it is fun to fill out Javascript code!
